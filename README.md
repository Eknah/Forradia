# Forradia
This is an indie game written in C++ which is utilizing OpenGL for 3D rendering.
It loads 3D models in Wavefront .obj-format (and materials in .mtl-format) and textures and sprites in .png-format, as well as a font in ttf-format. The wild-nature-themed maps are fully random-generated, at least in the projects current status.

# Motivation
The purpose of this project is mainly that I use it to improve my knowledge and experience in this technical areas, and eventually find collaborators. It is also a way for me to have fun and express creativity!
